I want to first design the home page :

Use the uploaded image as inspiration to create the Hero section.
    - Use the images from the testimonial_carousel folder 
    - Add three navigation buttons About Us, Meet the Bears, Carts (No need to route them anywhere yet, just make them responsive to clicks )
    - Add a "Shop BlindBoxes" button in the hero section which redirects to the blindboxes page. 
    - There should be an image carousel underneath the Hero section that constantly moves through

I want to design the Shop Blindbox page 
- Keep the sticky Navigation 
- The first section should be buttons navigation to the various collections. Currently we only have "Valentine's Day Collection" so keep the other collections faded and "comming soon"

- The next section will be for BlindBox Products 
    - Under this container, add two products :
        - Valentine's Day Blind Box 
        - Valentine's Day Blind Box Couple Package 
    - Use the images in the products folder 
    - Add the prices as well as shown on the image 

- Make clicks to these products responsive, but no need to redirect yet. 
- Use the uploaded image for inspiration
