I want to first design the home page :

Use the uploaded image as inspiration to create the Hero section.
    - Use the images from the testimonial_carousel folder 
    - Add three navigation buttons About Us, Meet the Bears, Carts (No need to route them anywhere yet, just make them responsive to clicks )
    - Add a "Shop BlindBoxes" button in the hero section which redirects to the blindboxes page. 
    - There should be an image carousel underneath the Hero section that constantly moves through
